# Web-Projects


I built the two apps using php, js, css and html . They were very simple pages that I designed during my self-study of web applications in order to understand how websites work in general. 

# The first application
is a website for a university that teaches courses. It contains a page for creating courses, a page to modify it, and an exhibition to display the courses. A registered student can book a new course. And the unregistered student can register with the admin authority to delete the student, modify his data, or add a new student. 

# The second application 
contains a site to display and manage a group of clubs.
